# Personal gear packing list

## Essentials

* **Photo ID** or you will be turned away at the put-in

* **Health insurance card** in case something goes awry

## Luggage

* **Large dry bag** to carry all of your stuff. It's best to have one very large dry bag (100L is good), but you can also use a couple smaller ones, although you will spend more time lugging your gear around

* **Small dry bag** to have during the day to stash your hiking gear if there's a mid-day hike (can be shared between two people)

* **Waist pack** or very small/lightweight backpack for carrying water and lunch during hikes

## Clothes

* **Drysuit** (optional but recommended)

* **Wool socks (3-4 pairs)**---you'll wear these under your drysuit, out hiking, while you're hanging around camp, and possibly while sleeping

* **Midweight capilene top/bottom** and **Heavyweight capilene top/bottom**---one of each---for wearing under your drysuit, for hiking on cold days, and in camp

* **Fleece** or other lightweight insulating jacket

* **Shorts** for hiking, not cotton

* **Shirt** for hiking, not cotton

* **Pants**, not cotton, to wear in camp

* **Down jacket**, an all-purpose warmer-upper

* **Rain jacket** for use in camp on rainy days

## Footwear

* **Raft footwear** to go on over your drysuit's feet---this could be legit drysuit booties or just a pair of extra sneakers that don't fit too snugly

* **Sneakers, running shoes, or other lightweight hiking footwear**---definitely not a serious hiking boot---also consider bringing an extra pair

* **Camp shoes** that you can keep dry

## Food gear

* **Thermos**---afternoons get cold and it's nice to put some hot tea in here in the morning so that you have something warm to drink later on

* **Water bottles (2)**---you'll want access to drinking water while you're on the boats, but you'll also need a bunch while hiking

## Hands and head

* **Bike gloves** for rowing (can be shared within your boat)

* **Wetsuit gloves** for keeping your hands warm while getting splashed

* **Other warm gloves** for wearing in camp

* **Sunglasses, strap, and extra pair of cheap sunglasses**

* **Hat** (baseball or other) to keep the sun out of your eyes on the river

* **Warm hat** like a ski hat for evening

* **Helmet** (optional)

## Personal care

* **Sunscreen**

* **Heavy-duty skin lotion**---your skin is going to crack and bleed if you're not using this liberally

* **Camping towel**

* **Toiletries** including standard items (toothbrush, etc.) as well as some Dr. Bronner's for bathing

* **Prescription medication**

* **Baby wipes** (optional)

## Gadgets

* **Headlamp**, not a flashlight

* **Plenty of batteries**

* **Pocketknife or river knife**

* **Camp chair**, an absolute necessity

* **Carabiners (2)**

## Sleep

* **Tent**---3-season is fine

* **Sleeping bag**---20-degree or better

* **Sleeping pad**---people like the thick Paco Pad for this trip because it is so long, but whatever you prefer

* **Pillowcase** you can stuff with a jacket, or a small camp pillow

## Fun (all optional)

* **Books**

* **Guidebook/map**---the map book you'd want is [here](http://amzn.com/0977674991) and the guidebook to the hikes is [here](http://amzn.com/0979505542)

* **Journal and pens**

* **Camera and film**

* **Games** including playing cards, travel Scrabble, etc.

* **Musical instruments**

* **Fishing gear**

* **Toys** such as frisbees, footballs, etc.

* **Party attire**, as inexplicably suggested by our outfitter's standard gear list (where they also propose nail polish and body paint)

## Phantom gear (all optional)

* **Addresses of friends**

* **Cash for postcards**

## Provided by our outfitters

You do **not** have to bring these items, as they are included in the price you've already paid:

* **50cal ammo can**---everyone has their own small, dry metal box (11" x 6" x 7 ") that you'll have easy access to during the day, even on the raft. Good for a small camera, snack, etc.

* **Kitchen/eating gear** except what's listed above---silverware, plates, a mug, etc. are all provided

* **Life jacket**---a nice one is provided for you

* **Food**---there is so, so much food already provided by our outfitter---unless we've already talked about this (because of a dietary preference), it's best not to bring any more
